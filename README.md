I noticed that the duration of the unstressed word "hablo" was .525 ms while the duration of the stressed word "hablÃ³" was slightly longer as .580 ms. The vowel alone of the unstressed \[o\] was .265 ms and the stressed \[o\] was .178 ms. THe intensity of the stressed \[o\] was also higher than the unstressed \[o\]. Regarding the pitch, I got 267.35 hz for the stressed \[o\], but only 234.65 for the unstressed \[o\]
